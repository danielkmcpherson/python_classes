In our class definition we used the prefix self when we defined these variables, this means these variables will be available to every method in the class, and we'll also be able to access these variables through any instance created from this class.

When we define them in our class we have to include the self parameter and it must come first. When we call a method, python automatically passes the self parameter, so we never need to include it in our method calls, but we do need it in our definitions. This parameter references the particular instance of a class we're working with, and gives the instance access to the attributes and methods of the class. We defined two methods in our Dog class, sit() and roll_over().\n",

    "Every class should have a short docstring immediately following the class definition giving a brief description of what the class does.\n",

    "When we import modules from both the standard library and one that we've written we place the import statement for the standard library module first, then add a blank line, and then the import statement for the module you wrote. This convention is here to make it easier to see where different modules in a program with multiple import statements come from."
